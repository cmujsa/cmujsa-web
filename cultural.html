                    <p>
                        Every semester, we hold numerous Japanese-culture related events, such as Suikawari, movie nights,  Japanese food cooking events, and trivia night. 
                        These events are a great opportunity to meet new members and to help de-stress during the school year.

                                Suikawari is a traditional Japanese game where players try to split a watermelon with a stick while blindfolded. 
                                Although usually played at the beach, JSA hosts this event annually on campus at the start of the school year 
                                as a way to celebrate the last few days of summer before Pittsburgh transitions into the fall season.

                                JSA is introducing a new series of events for the 2022-23 school year: Mini Cook Events! 
                                As a part of this bi-weekly series, we will be teaching our members how to cook various Japanese foods out on The Cut as a way to spread our passion for Japanese food culture. 
                                Specific dates and food items will be announced through JSA emails, so be sure to join our mailing list!

                                We love our Japanese movies and know that CMU students love them as well! 
                                From those who watch Japanese movies for the childhood nostalgia to those who have never watched a Japanese movie before, 
                                we welcome all members to join us during one of our movie nights for an entertaining and enriching evening. 
                                (There's usually snacks provided as well!)

                            <p>
                                Whether it's assembling care packages filled with Japanese snacks for finals week or making matcha hot chocolate in front of Doherty Hall during the winter season, 
                                JSA raises money through our various fundraisers. 
                                Come out to help us with tabling and bond with other JSA members as we bring Japanese culture to the CMU community!

                        This isn't the full list, but hopefully it can give you a good idea of what JSA does on the weekly even when there isn't a major event going on. 
                        If there's an activity you would like us to try next year, please let the executive board know!
